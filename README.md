# [Shaderworlds](https://shaderworlds.com)

This is an experimental project that allows you to explore shader worlds (think [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com)) using WebXR in the browser.

It enables you to move around in the shader worlds (walking, flying) and to interact with the shader worlds by providing controller information to them.
There is even an example where you can paint within a shader.

This is a super early release, but a milestone nonetheless - more docs and features are coming shortly.

All of the shaders are listed on the [front page](https://shaderworlds.com) with their origin and attribution. One shader used isn't, as it's 2D and used only for the demo video, but it's still great: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sK3RD by Flexi.
